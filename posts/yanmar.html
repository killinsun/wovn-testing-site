s to 1/2 ~ Delivering correct information globally in a timely manner while leveraging the benefits of machi
ne translation ~


As the world's leading company in the field of diesel engines, we have established the "YANMAR" bran
d. Currently, with a focus on industrial engines, we are expanding our business globally in areas such as
agriculture, construction machinery, marine, and energy systems . Yanmar Holdings is creating innovati
ons one after another for a resource-recycling society.
In promoting further global expansion of our business, we needed to increase our overseas recognition,
so we introduced WOVN.io and multilingualized our global corporate website. We heard that they were
able to achieve timely information dissemination while significantly reducing site operation man-hours
and costs.

### Manual operation of multilingual sites impairs the real-time nature of information.

#### Wakabayashi:

When operating corporate sites in various countries, the problem was "the low real-time nature of site information
updates." Some of the sites hadn't been updated in four or five years and still had the com pany's old mission. However,
in order to develop products globally, Yanmar is at a stage where it is nec essary to raise awareness of the company and
business overseas. For this reason, it was necessary to create a situation in which Yanmar's corporate website could be
viewed from any country or region an d the latest information would be posted correctly.

#### Kishida:

Previously, information in English was distributed to various locations, and local translation was used a s necessary.
However, the information in English was not seen so much, and after all, there were voice s asking for information to be
shared in the local language.

#### Wakabayashi:
Before introducing WOVN.io, the operation flow for updating the global corporate website was as follow s: ( 1) Create a
Japanese article, translate the article into English, then request an external translatio n company to translate the
English manuscript into multiple languages , (2) Translate the text. (3) Onc e the translation check is complete, upload
the text on the website, (4) Check the content again and f inally publish it. This series of operation flows was all
done manually, so it took a considerable amount of man-hours.
